### Strategy
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is intended to be a quick but fun to play game. Users get to play the Rock Paper Scissors game we all know and love but now with two new additional choices to make, Lizard and Spock.

### Scope

Features to be included:

* Responsive Design - The game/site should function correctly on screen sizes such as Mobile devices, Tablets, Laptops and Desktops. The design should allow users to have a pleasant experience while playing the game no matter what device they use.

* Navigation elements should be clearly visible to the user so that they can switch between the multiple screens without delay of looking for navigation elements.

* The user should have the choice of choosing which game they would like to play at the home screen.

* Audio elements should be clearly visible to the user so that they can switch between playing with game audio or playing with no audio.

### Structure

* The home screen will provide a list instructions on how to play the game and win.

* The game screen will provide scores for both the user and the computer so that the user can track if they are winning or losing as they progress through each round.

* A message will appear on the screen that will either congragulate the user for winning or display a message of commiserations if they lose.

* An audio file will be played when the game has finished, the sound will either be a satisfying or dissatisfying sound depending on if the user has won or lost the game.

* An icon that will represent the home screen will be available to the user so that they can click it if they would like to revisit the home screen.

* An icon that will represent the audio being on will be available to the user so that they can click it to toggle the game audio on and off.
